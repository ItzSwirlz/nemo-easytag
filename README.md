# nemo-easytag
Nemo extension for easytag. Fork of easytag-nautilus 2.4.3.

## This extension

This is a fork of GNOME's Nautilus extension for easytag. Due to the lack of major use in easytag, there is no reason to put this in upstream nemo-extensions repository. So, we will store it here as an extra.

## Packaging

Feel free. For Debian/Ubuntu: Most likely there is no reason for this in upstream Debian, so unless theres demand for this, I won't upload it into Debian. It'll be in the Ubuntu Cinnamon extras PPA (will be made soon).
